When I got to her, she was shy but then warmed up quickly to friendly petting. From petting, she was partially covered in mange, her ears & face crusty and loosing fur. We took her in and gave her the medical attention needed to cure her of that nasty skin problem (also to avoid having all the other stray cats being infected as well). We suspect that she was dumped out by someone when her mange infection got worst. Few weeks later, after the last of the mange, Chloe's fur grew back and she is now a beautiful kitten growing normally. While our other rescue dog was still around, Chloe would sneak out to play with the dog too. Chloe's got a distinctive gray pattern on her left eye, and cream pattern on her right. A gray comet-like pattern on her white-cream head, and a beautiful fluffy tri-coloured tail of mostly gray tones. She has pale blue eyes, her fur is medium-long 80% white, paws pink with patches of dark gray/black. Chloe is used to being around people, loves to play on her own or with us and will not hesitate to ""tell"" you when she is hungry or in need of affectionate pets. If her usual toys won't keep her busy, she is also a curious kitten, who would love to follow us around just to see what we are up to. When we are away for a while, we'd come home to find her sitting by the gate, waiting for us. Eversince the viral cat flu, we have kept Chloe indoors all the way, to which she's got no problems. Chloe is fully vaccinated, dewormed, checked for fleas (clean!) and has recently been spayed. We would like to find Chloe to find a good home and family who will love to have this curious kitty & take care of her throughout. We have no doubt that Chloe will be a great little vocal companion to your life if you're looking for a furry friend to call your own. The reason for the adoption fees : 1. Chloe has been trained to use the litter box. 2. She recognises her name and will come to you when called. In order for her to listen to you, you must first gain her trust. 3. Chloe is fed on a mixed diet of premium kiblets and also specially prepared clean, real food (fish meat, chicken meat..etc) in order to allow her to absorb the best of nutrients and grow as a healthy cat. 4. Her lovely long fur is kept as clean as possible. 5. She is also used to car rides and being around people. 6. Chloe understands that she has her sleeping routine and play times.

With the help of Malaysia Dogs Deserve Better I was able to find homes for 6 of them through their amazing adoption drives. Lily Lulu was the 'runt' of the litter - the small weak one that nobody wanted. I decided to raise her, rather than throwing her to the streets, however I'm not Malaysian, and due to some unfortunate circumstances I'm transferring to a country that's even less dog friendly, and I can't take her with me (Although I wish I could). She's house trained (does her 'business' outside) around 95%, she's fully vaccinated, dewormed, had Tic prevention medicine applied and has recently been neutered. She has a good temperement - sometimes a little nervous of loud noises, but very playful. As all puppies do, she went through the chewing furniture stage, but has now passed that as her adult teeth have grown through nicely. She has the run of the house - and doesn't mind regular or air con rooms - she's happy in either. She likes to play fetch, and to chew on a nice 'treat' from the pet store. She can 'Sit', 'Stay' and if out walking 'Car coming' makes her sit down and wait for the car to pass. She gets these right about 90 percent of the time. She's fed on a mix of wet food and dry food - and certainly enjoys a few treats from time to time. I would hope that her future home would treat her in a similar way to the way I've brought her up so far, and not to be passed to a family who has the sole intention of chaining up a dog outside 24/7. I have to return to the UK very soon, and I really don't want to just throw her on the streets. If I can't find a home before I leave, then the only option I will have will be to destroy her. That's something I really don't want to do - so please - if you're looking for a well behaved, fairly housetrained fun dog, that also is happy to mix with other dogs, consider giving Lily Lulu a home. I don't want any money to cover any of the expenses I've incurred - but if anyone did want to make a donation to Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better - They would certainly welcome it. I would hope that whicever family took her, we could keep in touch, and if I could get back to Malaysia to see her again. She would come complete with bed, heartworm prevention medication for the next 5 months and a generous supply of dog food.

Please call us if you can give Buster the home that he deserves! ******************** We found Buster last Sunday (13/4/14) in Bukit Indah, Ampang. He was clearly lost, and was frightened and confused. After spending ages trying to calm him down, we managed to get him home. Unfortunately he did not get along with one of our foster dogs at all. So we had to board him at our vet while we tried to locate his family. We have had no luck so far as no one has come forward to claim him although his picture has been shared alot and we have also put up posters in the area where we found him and in the surrounding tamans. He has however, been miserable at the vet and has refused food since Sunday. He has also been howling and trashing himself against the cage, trying to get out. We managed to get another foster carer today (/14) and he is feeling much better at the foster carer's place. We have discovered that he's okay with female dogs and puppies :) but dislikes adult male dogs. Buster is a really sweet dog and loves to sit and cuddle in your lap. He loves car rides too and would sit in your lap and look out the window quite happily. Buster needs to be in a home environment with someone who will give him lots of cuddles and love.

Please help if you can offer a loving home for one or more of them, and can committed to loving and caring for them for life. They are probably 2-3 months old, I can't really tell, very friendly and playful, needless to say, extremely adorable. Their mother is owned by a security guard and is tethered to a little guard station in Bandar Seri Damansara area. She gave birth to 12 puppies and the security guard did his best to feed and take care of them, but only managed to get 5 adopted so far. Leaving 7 puppies with their mama, mostly unsupervised, by the side of a street. They have reached the age where they are getting more and more curious everyday and are starting to venture a little bit farther from their mama each day. Other than the obvious danger, outdoor is no place for these puppies to grow up (with the constant rain etc, they will also need to be dewormed, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered). We bought a 30 pound bag of good quality dog food for the guard to lighten his financial burden of having to feed these many puppies and to give the nursing mama some much needed nutrients, but it will not last long. A friend who lives nearby has promised to check on them and give them treats when he jogs/drives by. We have also left a few toys for them to hopefully keep them entertained and keep them away from the street and from wandering too far away. If you are in the area, or know anyone who is thinking of getting a pet, or have connections to rescue groups, please share the pictures of these puppies and help them find their permanent/foster homes. The security guard can be found at Jalan Damar SD15/3 guard house and can be reached at . Rescues are the best breed! For every dog you adopt, you save two lives - the lucky guy who gets to go home with you, and you free up a space so that another dog gets saved from life on the streets.

Then I realized she's blind as there is no reaction in her eyes movement when my fingers go near her eyes and she walk without direction. I took her in hopefully to adopt her permanently but I am staying in condo. And about a week plus or so, I noticed that she can actually see because she was following my cats around. I thought its because she can hear them or smell them, but no its not. SUNNY IS NOT BLIND! That was a good news. And now she is super naughty and enjoys playing w the cats and eats w them. But she still need a proper place especially a landed property or garden she can run around. And she will bark and make noise one day and condo is not a place for her.

He took the opportunity socializing with other dogs and humans. What a day for Boy. He is still looking for adopter to provide him with a loving home. I will provide the leash, collar, food tray to successful adopter. Info on Boy : 1. He is about 1 year old Mongrel; 2. Very playful and understands basic commands; 3. Suitable as Guard Dog for the whole family; 4. Vaccinated (9 in 1) and Dewormed. Currently on monthly heartworm prescription.; 5. He loves treats very much. Not a fan of kibbles but sometimes he would still take it. He loves wet canned food and consume between 2 - 3 cans a day. My conditions : 1. I will only release Boy to adopter who can provide him a loving home. I will not release him to adopters who want him to guard factory, shops, office ect; 2. Please do not tie him up unnecessarily at home as he is used to walk/run free around my house compound; He is on leash only when I take him out for a walk; 3. Please try your best to walk him daily for his exercise; 4. Boy has been trained not to enter my house. He has been trained to stay outdoor but free to be anywhere he wants around the house compound. Therefore, please spend sometimes with him daily at least a couple of hours; 5. To continue giving him his scheduled vaccination and other normal medications prescribed for canines; 6. Last but not least, again, must provide him with a loving home. 7. Should Boy is adopted by you and later you found him not suitable or you are not able to provide him with love, please return Boy back to me. Thank you. ---------------------------------- Update 23 Oct : It has been about 1.5 months Boy has been under our care. It was really fun having him around us. We brought him to Central Park, One Utama the other day and Boy demonstrated his gentleness towards other dogs and humans who came to see him. It was a happy day for me to see Boy was enjoying his day at the Park. It is sad for me to give him away but I am not able to keep him permanently. And before Boy and I get too attached with other, I seek those who can provide Boy with a loving home to contact me asap. ----------------------- Update 17 Oct : Boy will be joining an event ""I Want To Touch a Dog"" at Central Park, One Utama on Sunday 19 October . He will be there as a Volunteer. If you're joining the event, please look up for him and say hello. Boy has now fully recovered from his injury. Boy still looking for a loving home. ----------------------- Update 6 Oct : Boy is now a ""legal"" resident. Obtained license for him at MPSJ. Now he is proud resident of Subang Jaya. Boy still looking for a loving home. ---------------------- Update 5 Oct : Boy has almost recovered from his injury and now is really playful and wonderful dog. Just brought him to the vet for a 9-in-1 vaccination today. For last couple of days he learned to play ""fetch"" and loves playing ""soccer"" with my kids. Just uploaded a new video of him playing ""fetch"" ----------------------- Playful Boy up for adoption. Very loyal and listen to your command. Give him a chance and he will be with you for life. Boy (this is what I call him) came to my house gate on Saturday morning 13 September looking scared and hungry and he was limping a bit due to swollen front left leg. I believe he had been hit by a moving vehicle or could have been hit by someone. Since I pity him, I fed him with my cat food and let him drink a lot of water. He was very cautious when I approached him. To cut long story short, he finally decided to enter my house compound and I have decided to provide him with shelter and food until he is ok or find a new home. I am not sure if he was a stray dog but he had no collar when he came to my house. I find him very gentle and too smart to be stray. he does not simply bark although the other dogs in the area are barking. Up todate he has become an excellent companion. This afternoon (Monday 22 Sep) a Vet came to my house just to check him up. Since he was afraid with the doctor, we were not able to vaccinate him. However, I have given him pills for deworming and pain killer for his swollen leg. Due to circumstances, I am not able to keep him permanently although it would be sad for me to let him go. I pray to God, a good samaritan would want to adopt him and provide him with a loving home. Please call me if you are the owner or interested to adopt or foster him. May God bless you.",a63f6c6a1,10.0,3,269,479,0.79999995,1.0,12,15,19,0.51768076,0.5013768,dog,0.9668478,0.2,27.0,en,Selangor,6555100,2725.0,0,0,0.00033344448149383126,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

He immediately paid a desperate call to pet rescuer, animal rights activist, and Pawse for a Cause founder, Seema Subash, for urgent assistance. She along with a member from her team, rushed to the site and rescued the puppies. They were only about palm-size at the time. Three months later, the puppies are still being fostered by her. They've received the required medical attention and have even been vaccinated. Seema is unable to permanently adopted Nemo and Dory because she already has other dogs in her care, pets who need her undivided attention. The brown puppy is female, while the white one is male. If you're serious about adding to your family, we are looking to have them adopted as a pair. It is crucial that they aren't separated since they are reliant on each other for their personal well-being and socialisation needs. For those keen on giving these puppies a new and loving home and second chance at life, do feel free contact me at (Deb) for an appointment with their current fosterer, Seema, to meet Nemo and Dory. They're super cute, bubbly as ever, enjoy a great time, and you'll absolutely love them. A little bit of love goes a long way.

Hailey was rescued about 2 months ago in Desa Sri Hartamas. She was a lone pup most likely abandoned. Hailey was close to death when she was rescued. Severely malnourished and anemic she could barely stand. She had major hookworm infestation and the worse case of fleas I had ever seen. It was heartbreaking to see such a tiny little dog endure so much. Her blood count was so low that a blood transfusion was needed. But like her vet says..Hailey is a fighter and a survivor! She was such a good patient throughout her treatment and rehabilitation. It was so easy to administer her meds and when she got her appetite back she would eat anything I fed her..no complaints, no rejection . Thankfully, she is now a happy and healthy girl. She is also very intelligent. She learned the commands sit and down in a day and would go back to her cage when she's instructed to. Although it breaks my heart to give her up for adoption, I feel she deserves much more than what a condo habitat can offer. Hailey received her first vaccination a few days ago and is due for her 2nd in a month. Her adoption is only open to genuine dog lovers who will take her in as part of the family . Adopter must agree to spay her in February before her first heat. If you are keen on giving Hailey her forever loving home, please contact Kin at.",bfdff0622,3.0,4,639,639,0.79999995,1.0,26,40,72,0.049976025,0.20429663,dog,0.95633197,0.1,8.8,en,Kuala Lumpur,1746600,3037.0,0,0,0.0006668889629876625,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1

We recently took him home from the SPCA as an addition to our family but unfortunately, he's been clashing with our resident dog, Sunshine! They just do NOT get along, which is unfortunate as Norman is a great little dog on his own. Norman would be perfect in a one-dog household. He's loving, smart and LOVELY with kids. Very friendly with people and other dogs - except ours! Actually, our first dog is the one with the territorial issues. Norman is already neutered, housetrained and learning his commands quickly. He's a 2.5 year old schnauzer-poodle mix. He has been vaccinated and dewormed, I have also had my vet examine him (all at great expense) - he is in perfect health. I have also had him tested for heartworms - and he is negative and has been given a yearly heartworm vaccination. Please get in touch if you'd like to adopt him. I do not want to send him back to the SPCA if I can help it, but my family and Sunshine cannot put up with the dog-fights and chaos in our home (the dogs live indoors) for much longer. It's been 2 weeks since we brought him home and it's just not working out. I think Norman would be perfect for you if you don't already have a dog in your home. Though I do not think the fault lies entirely with Norman, our other dog was here first! Please sms me ONLY if you are serious and willing to take him on soon, and I will call you back.

I will keep them for another week or so and then I may have to let them go to a residential area with the hope a good samaritan will adopt them. Please help. I am ok to sponsor the spaying and vaccination costs. Call me at.

When we found them, they were so hungry and so slim their backbone shows! They are now perfectly healthy and active. We already brought them to the vet clinic and have them dewormed and deflea and the doctor said they were 1 and a half months old. They are still too young for vaccination though. These two loves to play and very spoiled. They are litter-trained and can already eat dry food. One of them is male - white coloured with black spots on his head and black tail. The other is female - white coloured with black and ginger spots, also have a black and ginger tail. They need to be resheltered as we already have 4 cats they get in a fight so much we have to put these two in the cage at all times to avoid injuries.

He has on a frayed yellowish collar, so he could've been lost for a while, as he's also very skinny, and he's already neutered when found. Estimated age to be about 1 year old, as he still pees like a gal and has young teeth and good skin. Found in Ara Damansara, though he could've come from anywhere if he's been lost for sometime. He knows how to sit, shake hand and come. He can walk off-leash following people (those who show kindness to him). He sits well in the car. VERY PEOPLE FRIENDLY (so must've been treated very well by humans during his early months). He was hanging around near an unoccupied house in the residential area with the two other dogs despite occasionally being beaten by one particular resident who dislike ""strays."" They also take shelter at a nearby field in the residential area. They've been roaming the area probably since December . If nobody claims him in a week, we'd like to have him adopted! This is a dog that will reward it's keepers with affection and guarding of family property! He is kept at a neighbour's house for a few days, and he will bark at unknown passers-by and unknown cars parked near the house. Would be great if adopters take in another of his buddies from the streets too. He loves attention and freedom. When chained, will whine CONTINUOUSLY for attention if he knows that dog-lovers are within hearing distance. When left to roam free within the compound of the home, he's a real darling! He's quiet, he naps, he's playful when people are around, he's alert when he sees strangers - the perfect dog for a family who'd spend time playing and running/walking him! He makes a wonderful companion dog as well as an alert dog (eg. alert family of possible intruders). Would be great if new owners can take in 2 or more pets. We've taken in this lovely dog and his 2 companions, and he seems to love having other dogs around! Note: SAFE AROUND CATS! He's curious in chasing and approaching them, but non-agressive and stays 2 feet away from usually hissing cats that he approaches! update on: 1st Feb Open for adoption!!! This darling doggie is now kept with another stray who appears to be the ""brother"". The brother was found intact, and when they first started roaming Ara Damansara, was average in weight. however, after roaming for over a month (as sighted by rescuer), he got skinnier and skinnier. The brother is very good on leash, hardly barks, just wags tail when see loving humans and doesn't jump. would be great if a family can adopt BOTH DOGS, as they tend to be happier and quieter and get to play together.",b857d5ac6,6.0,3,395,399,0.79999995,1.0,41,76,117,0.010490428,0.22650924,dog,0.9555973,0.3,14.6,en,Selangor,6555100,2725.0,0,0,0.00033344448149383126,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,3,1,1

We will truly miss her and hope that someone can give her a new loving home. May is friendly and loving, but also a very good guard dog. She doesn't bite or is destructive to things - even our shoes and slippers were completely untouched! May is pretty obedient, when we need her to head into her cage she does it obediently on command. We used to give her car rides often too, so she loves it and doesn't panic while in it. Another lovable trait is that she almost behaves like a cat! She loves to keep her body close on an owner's leg, often sitting down or taking naps next to the closest human being. We hope someone will give her a home as we don't want to send her to adoption shelters. :(",21b90ff68,2.0,4,359,479,0.79999995,1.0,183,190,208,0.09965636,0.13878518,dog,0.9681038,0.3,6.7,en,Kuala Lumpur,1746600,3037.0,0,0,0.00033344448149383126,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Kate is one of these cats, and is looking for a ""forever"" home where she can share her love and affection with an understanding owner. I estimate she is around one year old, and she was caught along with two kittens which are also up for adoption (same tabby stripe markings, also up for adoption). Although she has not been vaccinated/ dewormed/ spayed yet, all of these will be done if you agree to adopt her. She has a full tail.

He may be a scrawny under nourished little kitty, but he remains healthy, strong, curious and brave. And from the first day itself, he understands that he's been saved and shows his gratitude by giving head bonks, purrs and belly rolls. Therefore, he is suitable for a person who wants a cat with intelligence and a strong personality with an instinct to protect what he considers as his. Some important info: * His weight on 27 May when he was found was grams. * De-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 27 May. * Vaccination was done on 2 June . Another de-worming was given. On this date, his weight was grams. * Next vaccination is 2 July . The adopter has to make sure his 2nd vaccination is given on time. * Litter box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

A friend had called to say that a puppy had just suddenly turned up in her housing area all alone. The neighbours threatened to call DBKL eventhough she was such a wee pup. So Nicole Suresh﻿ and I headed over there as soon as we could and picked her up. We gave her a quick bath as she had quite a few ticks and thankfully we managed to get a foster carer for her who will be looking after her until she is ready for adoption. We have decided to call her Dakota as she is so friendly, and the name Dakota literally means friend. She's also very good with other dogs and got along with the foster carer's dogs immediately. We have just dewormed her and she's going for a check up tomorrow. She will be vaccinated after a week or two as we need to make sure that she hasn't got any underlying health problems.

It's almost impossible to tell who is who in their picture, hence this 2-in-1 adoption notice. They are part of the 5 kittens born at my place, so it would be preferable if they are adopted with at least one of his brothers/sister, as below: Saffron: Sesame: Sundae: The main difference between Sago and Sugar is their character. Sago is the gung-ho adventurous kitten. He is always the first kitten to pop out of the cage when it's opened. And the first kitten to explore new areas. Sugar will usually stay behind at familiar spots and is more timid. Sometimes Sugar can be identified by his softer tail with a slight curl at the end. Basic facts: * born on 2 Oct * checked by vet on 3 Nov .

My foster mummy's friend found me in a storm drain with my brother and sister when we were less than 2 weeks old. It was raining and we cried for our cat mother but she didn't come. So, mummy's friend climbed into the drain and rescued us. Unfortunately she didn't know how to care for such young kittens so she passed us onto our foster mummy.. We were weak and sickly but mummy tried to keep us alive with bottles of kitten formula and visits to the vet. Sadly, my brother and sister died after two weeks when they caught terrible viruses. I'm the only survivor. Now, I'm strong and old enough to be adopted by someone kind, loving, and responsible. I'm hand-reared so that means i will be a great companion. I'm not afraid of people because they are all i know. Sometimes i think i'm human too. Because i'm hand-reared, i lack some of the skills that other cats have. For example, i do not know how to groom myself properly, the person who adopts me must bathe me and brush my hair every week. I also lack survival skills and i'm not familiar with any of the dangers otuside so i must be an INDOOR cat. My foster mummy could not teach me any normal cat behaviors but I am totally litter-box trained. It would be great if the adopter has another cat, a very patient one, that i can learn from and play with. Here are some details about me: Current diet: Royal Canin Babycat 34 Dewormed: Once, two weeks ago, to be repeated again soon. Litterbox trained: I use the litterbox all the time. Vaccinations and Neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Adopter must pay for the vaccinations and neutering. I am an INDOOR cat. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT.

GERBERA is a tropical plant of the daisy family, native to Asia and Africa, with large brightly colored flowers. Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time. Poor little baby was hiding under a car and meowing loudly seeking for help as there were a group of excited dogs wanted to hunt her and they kept running and waiting around the car. With help of some kind people there, we managed to shooed those doggie away and brought her home. Gerbera loves a lot to have companion and friends, she do not like much to be cuddled but she will always stay beside you and ask for a pat and ""massage"", she lovesss a lot when people sayang her. Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone..

I couldn't afford to keep him any more as my dogs cant get along with him and started to bark every night when I put him in the house. Once he is not in the house, he will join other strays and often come back with injuries. The worst part now I will be relocating to KL and unable to bring him along as I will be staying in a condo. He is very obedient, loyal and protective towards his owner. He never pees or poos in my house or bite anything. If you are looking for a watch dog he is definitely what you are looking for.

Saya mula memberi dia makan semenjak 2-3 bulan yang lepas. Dia muncul di rumah saya secara tiba2 & dari entah mana. Saya pun terus memberikan dia makanan & minuman setiap hari. Umur Fifi ni saya tak pasti, tapi saya rasa dia belom mencapai umur setahun lagi. Seminggu dua lepas, saya perasan yang dia ada kurap sedikit di bahagian telinga jadi saya terus bawa dia ke vet. Alang-alang tu, saya ambil keputusan untuk spay/mandulkan Fifi sekali. Sekarang luka pembedahan pemandulan/spaying Fifi serta kurapnya sudah hampir pulih. Dulu masa mula2, Fifi agak garang & amat takut dengan manusia, walaupun dengan saya yang setiap hari bagi dia makan. Tapi, lepas bawak dia balik dari spaying ni, baru saya tahu yang rupa-rupanya Fifi ni adalah seekor kucing yang teramat manja & perlukan kasih sayang & belaian. Dia langsung dah tak garang lagi malah akan kerap datang dekat dengan saya untuk menggosok2 badannya. Pendek kata, sekarang Fifi amat friendly & sangatlah manja. Saya rasa sayang & kesian sekiranya kucing yang manja sebegini terus hidup sebagai seekor kucing stray, jadi saya nak put her up for adoptian. Moga2 Fifi akan dapat forever home & tuan yang akan menyayanginya dengan sepenuh hati. Tiada apa-apa caj yang dikenakan. Fifi pun telah di spay. Adopter hanya perlu memastikan Fifi akan divaksinkan & dinyahkutu & dinyahcacing dalam masa terdekat. That's all. Fifi ni seekor stray cat yang bersifat teramat-amat manja. It would be a pity if she remains a stray after her spaying surgery. Hence I'm looking for an adopter for her. Dia suka dengan belaian & sentuhan orang & akan mengiau-ngiau sehingga dapat belaian dari orang. Dia juga bersifat attention-seeking dan suka berada di mana sahaja orang berada. She needs a lot of loving. Please adopt her someone.

Alyssa has been diagnosed with skin problems and her eye is suffering of minor injury, she’s still a very young doggie (around 2 years old) and we are looking for a new home for her. We need adopter who is % responsible and able to take good care of Alyssa.",cae004390,5.0,3,399,299,0.79999995,1.0,89,114,133,0.04942768,0.18432565,boston terrier,0.9620486,0.0,2.8,en,Johor,3794200,2124.0,0,0,0.0016672224074691564,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1

He has the loudest purr too. ♥ Demetri loves people and is easy with other cats (he will adjust fast as long as they're not aggressive towards him) - he will also be the first to explore any new environment or say hello to our vets / visitors. ♥ Demetri will do wonderful in a home where he'll receive lots of petting and affection. He's gentle when he plays and never uses his claws - hence mature children or even babies will make wonderful sidekicks! ♥ Demetri is on the road to recovery from a mild case of flu and is otherwise healthy. He has been dewormed, deflead and is very clever with the litter box. Prefers wet food over dry (although not a picky eater). ***PLEASE READ (Note for adopters)***: ○ Demetri must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments need to be cat-safe. ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire to know more, this is for any cats long term welfare.

He would purr when being stroked. He would eat treats from my hand. He would follow me around at home and rub against me. He can get along with other cats. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The adopter must be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the cat and forgo the need for house visits to check on him. 3) The kitten must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 6 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM59 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will just cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. 8) Adopt him at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Murphy, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate?

They are a playful bunch and are in need of a forever home. Just a few conditions to adopt (because we want the best for these furry babies!) : 1) Please do not chain or cage them :( 2) Commit to daily walks 3) Allow dogs indoors (think of the horrible heat outside!) 4) Agree to spay after 3 months.

Here is the summary of Lulu's life... Came to my residence few yrs ago. Often hides underneath drain due to the dog-haters here. When it rains, she'll still hide underneath despite rising water level. I had a dog & she does not like Lulu around. So I built her a make-shift shelter outside my house & feed her. A new neighbor moved in. I talked to them & they decided to take her & named her Lulu. For a time being, she had proper shelter & food. Recently, the wife is pregnant & they decided to throw Lulu away at a Malay village..! I was furious & scolded him. A friend helped to get Lulu a temporary place at a pet store (My Pet Centre, Setia Alam). The owner agreed not to charge me boarding fees as long as I pay for the dog food, vaccination & spaying costs. Although it was a burden on me, but I have paid all the costs. Lulu is now recovering from her spaying surgery this week. But owner of pet store wanted Lulu out before Hari Raya!! Time is ticking for Lulu.. She is a super friendly dog & does not bark excessively. She has the look of a long-hair Jack Russell terrier. Please help to share for possible adoption by any dog lovers, thank you all.",7a7277559,1.0,4,399,299,0.79999995,1.0,116,121,123,0.23109607,0.1888651,dog,0.96894777,0.1,6.9,en,Selangor,6555100,2725.0,0,0,0.00033344448149383126,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1

But before that please do consider the responsibilities of being an owner and decide only after serious consideration. There is no point in wanting these kitties out of impulse and then deciding to abandon or give them away later. Animals have feelings too and the right thing to do is to treat them as a part of the family and not just as a pet. Together we can make this world a better place for all living things and help save lives. Interested parties please sent a message (via petfinder.my) / facebook private message / email and please share about yourself (eg Malaysian/expatriate?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Any juvenile-type e-mails without providing the necessary details (ie tell us about yourself, your place and cat ownership experience) required will be not be replied. Please don't just provide a phone number because we won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for the felines. All this resulted from our experience in rescuing and rehoming cats. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship. The important thing is to look at them as a part of our loved ones and not just another animal. Where there is love, relationship and trust will grow. Please help us to continue helping other abandoned and stray animals.",060e4ed30,2.0,4,399,264,0.79999995,1.0,29,28,30,0.20239969,0.49253848,cat,0.9929856,0.0,13.2,en,Selangor,6555100,2725.0,0,0,0.001333777925975325,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him.

Candy - Female; Light brown; Blue eyes Muffin - Male; Mixed black & brown; Black eyes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Due to the overwhelming response from my last listing (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 13-May-. This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) Please do not adopt the puppies from us and resale them. We have lots of contacts. If you are trying to sell the puppies, we will know & we will catch you. (7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 7 points, please read on:- (8) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (9) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (10) No reservations please. First come first served. (11) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. (12) All who are interested, please send an email to . If you need clarifications, please call  or . Please leave me an SMS if you can't get me.",0ac2e7d16,20.0,1,399,219,0.79999995,1.0,96,146,198,0.029767552,0.18575157,dog,0.988188,0.0,11.9,en,Selangor,6555100,2725.0,0,0,0.0010003334444814939,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1

She came to us two years ago when she was roaming the street, having been abandoned or thrown out by her previous owner. She then decided to adopt us (yep - she waited in front of our gate every day until we took her in) and has since been the reason for many laughs. Even though she must have had bad experiences before she is very trusting and curious and I have never seen her aggressive towards people. She will always try to stay close to one of us. Although she is very alert she rarely barks and is generally very calm. She has learned some commands but needs some additional training to listen really well. Rosie would be ideal for a family with kids as she is very gentle and patient. She is currently living inside the house as well as outside in the garden, so please no small cages or chain for her. Even though we leave the dogs alone during the days she has never chewed or destroyed anything. I hope a new family can give her the life and love she deserves.

Groomed, and checked by the vet. Free from any visible diseases except for a mild skin condition and severely underfed. Have checked with Vets and pet stores around the area but have failed to find a match. After just one day, she is regaining her appetite and is doing well. Potty trained, and would only do her business outside. Unfortunately I cannot keep her, she is currently boarding at the kind-hearted groomers till today for free. If by today there are no fosterers or adopters, she will be sent to SPCA :( I have tried posting this in numerous sites, but sadly have gotten no results. I'd decided to name her ""megan"" for now. Megan is obedient and caring, well tempered and perfect for a small family. For more info check out: If you are interested please CALL ME IMMEDIATELY at. UPDATE: Due to the numerous amounts of calls regarding breeding Megan. I shall have two conditions for adoption. 1. Megan MUST be spayed. Spaying costs are to be shared equally. 2.

Is weary of bigger adult cats and only approaches if they're friendly (not growling or hissing).

After falling very ill with tick fever and being attacked and mauled by the strays in the area, Stan and his wife decided she had to get of the streets. I am fostering Lassie and she has been with me for about 2 months. She loves other dogs and will have no trouble going to a family with other dogs. She will chase nervous cats but does not hurt them. Confident cats who stand their ground get their due respect. She is beautiful; I think a cross between Border Collie and Labrador. She learns fast and is eager to please. She is calm indoors but can walk and run for hours if you're the active type. She may knock small children over with her enthusiasm but there isn't an ounce of malice in her and this will subside with age. Moreover she prefers to snuggle up and nap with her people.

These fluffy siblings urgently need a home, as due to household circumstances I can't keep them past May 5th. They were found skinny and a little raggedy in a fishy styrofoam box by Brickfields Monorail station, but after a good cleaning, some healthy feeding, and a trip to the vet to thoroughly remove any extra ""guests"" they had, they're proving to be two lively, curious bundles of joy. (See the videos section to see what I mean!) Suit (Soot) is an adventurous girl who loves to climb and loves to eat even more, while Tie is a little more polite gentleman who loves it when he's being gently cleaned or combed. They are approximately just under 4 weeks old and currently being weaned on soft kitten food.

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 2 March . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) Please do not adopt the puppies from us and resale them. We have lots of contacts. If you are trying to sell these puppies, we will know & we will catch you. (7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 7 points, please read on:- (8) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (9) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (10) No reservations please. First come first served. (11) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. (12) All who are interested, please send an email to . If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at. Please leave me an SMS if you can't get me.",68838474a,12.0,2,398,209,0.79999995,1.0,51,76,114,0.05434243,0.34575185,dog,0.9790682,0.0,12.1,en,Selangor,6555100,2725.0,0,0,0.0010003334444814939,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1

Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders’ requests will not be entertained. We’ll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property? (Yes/No) 7) Do you stay in a house/flat/apartment/condo? 8) Will there be someone at home when you are away for work or school? 9) Do you have a pet of your own? (Pet's details - Name, age, dog/cat, spayed, etc.) 10) Do you cage your pets? Why? 11) If your pet doesn't want to eat its food, what will you do? 12) How are you going to manage or take care of a dog which makes ""Running Away"" its lifetime profession?",1528d2a61,12.0,2,299,399,0.79999995,1.0,33,75,117,0.060440514,0.3053837,dog,0.9852134,0.0,10.3,en,Selangor,6555100,2725.0,0,0,0.00033344448149383126,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,1

Stacey can be manja at times but most of the time she will prefer to run around curiously to explore every nook and cranny. She had been dewormed, but not vaccinated. Litter trained, and eats Fussy cat wet food + Acana kibbles. Stacey is a brown tabby with no tabby markings on her body, just on the head, legs and tail.

He was rescued off the streets as a puppy with his brother and was sent to a shelter. His brother was adopted and since then Rosco grew up alone in a noisy hectic place. He is the sweetest and friendliest dog ever and the only reason why he hasn't been adopted by any dog lover is that he doesn't get along with other dogs. With humans, he is an absolute angel. Friendly, playful, smart, obedient. But somehow, volunteers have been working really hard to get him over his only vice (hostile to other dogs) and haven't been successful. Hence, he urgently needs a loving home whereby he will be only dog and will be showered w TLC and cuddles. He would be a great companion and pet for anyone as long as he is the only dog in the house. He is a real sweetheart and even has a heart on his forehead!

She also allowed Eileen to handle her kittens. That was the start of a beautiful friendship and suddenly Eileen had three kittycats on her hands.. Sweet Pea is the mama cat. She has a unique beautiful tortoiseshell coat and large, round, green eyes. She is very affectionate and sweet, a loving mother and would be a great companion for any cat lover. She's about 3 years old and received her first vaccination on December 6, . Dora is the adventurous rascal of the family. She's a marmalade tabby with bright blue eyes. She loves exploring and isn't scared of new people and places. She's always the first one to check things out. Sidney is a little shyer than his extraverted sister. He has green eyes and sleek black fur. He loves wrestling and tumbling around with his sister.. He's also mummy's boy and sticks to Sweet Pea.

The first here is named Denzel, the cutest of the litter, but he's unfortunately not as smart as his other siblings. He's a little shy and quiet but is very playful with his siblings. They are able to eat wet and dried food. But for now, mostly wet food and slowly introduce them to dried ones. Denzel can already use the litter box, so he is toilet trained.

The vet said one leg is broken and needs complete rest for 1 month. As my home was under renovation I could not take it home, so it has been looked after by the vet for 6 weeks now and I will pay them. It’s now time for it to have a home and has lost weight because it doesn’t like being caged. It is a very well behaved kitten.

She is sadly Heartworm positive and will be treated for it..She was officially fostered on the 13th of Feb and will be under the care of a very kind samaritan for 2 months. We hope a suitable person would come forward to welcome her with open arms with a forever home..we know she is at that age but has been through a lot. Can you imagine having a choke collar on yourself, your whole life? See the 'rafia' tied on her choke collar? Yes, I got it snipped off and hopefully the fosterer would be able to get her choke collar off. What is wrong with human beings! The Starbucks trip could wait, Starbucks won't go anywhere. Even if one Starbucks gets demolished, more would appear..But there are billions of animals in need and there will always be one buddy or clara or we will call her every loving name in the entire world!..Just like there is only one of us out of the billions of people out there. If you want a dog that is just there as an accessory or if you just want a dog that is healthy, I guess you don't have to read further but I hope the least you could do is place yourself in her shoes and share about her. I been asked if her chances of being adopted is high. I don't have a crystal ball people, I'm not God either so your question is bizarre to me, but as bleak as it may seem to many of you, I want to remain hopeful that a responsible and caring adopter would come forward wanting to care for her like a child who would stand by their elderly parent with ailments. Buddy was sent to me I believe..God had a task for me on that day. That day where a man cockily rang the bell and asked me to place water for the dog. Of course I would though I was put off by him. Man claimed dog followed him from the bus stop but he was reluctant to stay even for one minute with the dog while I gathered the food, the water? Doesn't click. Dog wanders up and down..people, hah, people were so unkind in general. I could go 'excuse me sir, excuse me, excuse me maam' and what? They just ignored me. To top it off, employer appeared displeased with the dog's presence, but adviced on placing food at the bus stop and just letting her wander off. If one knows me well enough, such 'advices' goes into into my left ear, out through my right ear. I made calls in secrecy. Managed to find a neighbour of this kind couple who housed her for two nights. 8 am the next day, I had to collect her. Would be at work with me but I was only allowed to place her outside of the clinic (yup, I work in an animal clinic indeed). Imagine the scorching heat, imagine the thunder, the rain and I couldn't. Mind you, couldn't even board her. Not because I had no money. I was simply not allowed to. As shitty as that was, good thing, I went by what I stood for and I wasn't a moron to listen to such advices. I've my own personal values. I would have slept with her outside of the clinic at night if that was what it took even because no way was I going to leave her to fend for herself. Thankfully a kind lady contacted me through the internet and agreed to foster her for 2 months. So again fellow Malaysians or expats or people holidaying here etc, before you go for your next Starbucks fix or debating on what clothes to buy, please take a moment and reflect on this. The fosterer and me are really hoping we could find a suitable person to give her a permanent home...We want the end of her days to be filled with love, compassion... If you are that person, please contact me Yasmin at. Its best for you to sms me first because I work such long hours. More pictures and any necessary updates will be provided. We can't predict what will happen within this two month period but..we do need fosterers as a back up.. So please, we could end up like Clara..alone, lost, left to wander about when we're old, hoping for the mercy of another human being. Think about it. Someday, we could be sitting outside of Starbucks, begging for dough..from the outside, looking in and all of the 'too caught up with the Starbucks buzz' people who reminded you of yourself when you were younger would all turn a blind eye at you and hey, remember back then that dog you didn't want to give your time for? Reality would blow you real hard when you see a dog wandering on the streets, comforting you. Just think about it. Its no Hollywood script. Its reality. Think about it.

It was around 7:45 AM... It was Monday, 12 January... I was outside the house at Jasmine Park, guarded area and have fences around the houses... I heard a screaming sound... I thought it was a cat screaming... But then my sister went to look for it and she saw a dog running scared in the middle of the street... On the main road (jalan besar) in front of my house... People were busy going to work, school... They tried to avoid hitting the dog... But i'm afraid something worse would happen.... Immediately i grabbed a pair of gloves and run to the main road... i caught the dog... Fortunately all cars were slowing down.. Probably because they saw me trying to save that dog... That dog was clean... No sign of it like it was a stray dog... Then i asked around... They saw someone, an Indian guy, with motorcycle, dump the dog near the main street... I got the dog safely to my house, put it in the cage... Just so you know, i'm a Malay... Have more than 23 cats in my care... I couldn't afford to care for a dog because of few difficulties.. I think some of you would know... No need for me to explain it. So it would be helpful if somebody could adopt this dog... I think it is a boy...

Our mommy is a resident stray at our fosterer's house. We have two other siblings, Cookie and Oreo, who are also up for adoption. We hope to find a new home within the next month. Our fosterer already has 5 cats of her own, plus other resident strays (including mommy) to feed. Jebat is a darling male kitten who is the most sociable and adventurous. He is a handsome black tabby with white socks and tummy, as well as a lovely long tail. Cleo is the prettiest and bravest among all. She has gorgeous fluffy white coat with creamy-brown marble patterns, as well as big blue eyes. We are currently on IAMS kibbles and wet food diet. We have been litter box trained (we're total pros at it!). We are clean and healthy, having been Frontlined and dewormed. We both like to play with each other and chase anything that moves, particularly toy balls and feathered teaser sticks. We also love cuddles and kisses, and our fosterer gives us lots of those. We would like to be adopted together and hope our new family will cuddle and kiss us all the time too! It would be the best thing ever if our new family could love and give us a forever home. :) Please contact our fosterer Aida at if you would like to adopt us. Thank you! :) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (P/S: all potential adopters are required to fill in the adoption form and decision will be made after giving the answers/feedback careful consideration in favour of Jebat & Cleo's current and future well-being.

Bagheerah has since bloomed tremendously and is now seeking a loving family. --------------------------------------------------------------- Details: ♥ Bagheerah is an EXTREMELY affectionate boy and loves, loves, LOVES people! (Please view videos below, although only visits could do his character justice!). ♥ A softie - Bagheerah is extremely gentle. Would do great in homes with elderly people or children. He never uses his claws except when playing or giving love nips. ♥ He's friendly around other (non-agressive) cats as well, submissive and calm. Adapts very quickly to new environments! ♥ Bagheerah been fully vaccinated, dewormed (twice), is scheduled for neutering. He is clever with the litter box and not fussy about food.

He loves trips to the garden under supervision now and then. Apartments best if cat-safe. ○ He would also appreciate a healthy diet (no commercial foods like Whiskas, Friskies etc).

Thank God, she has recovered fully! Emily is a half Doberman Pinscher. She is very playful, sweet, passionate and loves to go for long walks. She waits all day long for me to return home to take her for a walk. Unfortunately, I will be leaving Malaysia in 6 months and I cannot bring her back with me. Please someone be kind and give this little baby a proper, sweet home and she will be your true best friend until her last moments on Earth! All the best, Dino PS.

Long-coated Coon/DLH mix with pretty hazel eyes. ♦ Guinevere was rescued while she was trying to cross a busy street. She was very weak at the time:- dehydrated, had fleas, flu and also diarrhea. She was taken to the vet and consequently treated at home. ♦ Guinevere's recovery process has gone tremendously well! No more flu, parasite free and growing fast - only her still sensitive tummy means she needs a maintenance of her gentle diet until she grows out of the runs. Character details: ♦ Guinevere is a VERY loving girl. She's social bug and is not at all scared of her vets visits or new people / situations. She's curious about our other cats as well as our dogs! ♦ Do not be fooled by her size, she's a bundle of energy and loves loves LOVES to play. Strings, paper balls, tunnels, she enjoys them all. Guinevere does play-bite hence she'll need someone who can match her energy and teach her the discipline she'll need. ♦ She has already been dewormed and given flea/parasite prevention. Tested negative against any serious viruses, healthy temperature throughout and has gained a great deal of weight. Guinevere is still too young to be vaccinated. She's not fussy at all about food and is very clever with her litter box. ------------------------------------------------------------ [IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters: • Guinevere needs a % indoor home for her own safety. Apartments should be cat safe. • Spaying is a MUST - there are way too many homeless kittens like her on the streets. • Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Guinevere needs her bland / gentle diet maintained and possibly experimented with until her digestive sensitivity is sorted (as much as none of this bothers her one bit!). • Refundable fees apply (please inquire). Please drop me a text (WhatsApp or SMS) or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this little girl home. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated.

Be warned that she is a licker :) 2) She protectively guards the house, barking when people are near. So she makes a great guard dog/doorbell. 3) She does NOT bark all the time and annoy the neighbours 4) She is intelligent, e.g. she knew how to use my dog potty mat without any training, and will obey if you tell her to sit instead of jumping on you when you're eating. 5) She's not hyperactive but active enough that you can jog with her if you want a jogging companion. 6) Fully vaccinated, dewormed and spayed with no known health problems. However she was previously abandoned and possibly abused by her previous owner, resulting in some occasional aggression due to insecurity and fear. While she is friendly with most people and male dogs, she is occasionally (not always) aggressive when around other FEMALE DOGS, and in SMALL CONFINED SPACES or TIED UP for too long BY HERSELF. Meaning under these conditions, she might growl, snarl and in the case of female dogs, potentially fight with the other dog, but not all the time as she is usually playful with other females once she is used to them. She does NOT have this problem with male dogs and she also does NOT bite people, including children, unless you intentionally agitate her (in which case, you shouldn't be adopting a dog). So if you're an experienced dog owner with an open heart and willing to give an occasionally temperamental dog a loving home, please read on. Interested adopters should: - Be experienced in keeping dogs, as well as able to keep calm and handle somewhat aggressive dogs. Angel can easily be approached by a person she trusts and touched to calm her down as I do this often. - Preferably already have a mature and friendly MALE dog to keep her company, especially if you are frequently away. No female dog owners, for the reasons stated above. I have a male dog whom Angel gets along with perfectly fine. - Preferably have garden/porch for her to run in when you are out. Although she is used to living in a house, she will get agitated if you leave her in the house alone. She is fine if left by herself in a garden whole day or if someone or another dog is with her in the house. I'm giving Angel up not because I cannot stand her behaviour, but because I wish to do more dog rescue work which involves me temporarily keeping unfamiliar dogs, including nursing mothers, at my house, and I do not want her attacking the female dogs. Also because I may plan to move overseas in a few years and will take all my dogs, but Angel will be extremely stressed if in a plane and quarantine for a long period. Thanks for reading, and if interested to give Angel a wonderful forever home, please call Carol at.

The mum, Bailey was and is unbelievably gentle and trusting from the start, and just wonderful (she's also looking for a home). She was incredibly skinny and had some skin issues but is now looking times better. Fast forward 5 weeks, after a five hour road trip to Johor Bahru, plenty of love, care and attention, these pups are now 2 months old and ready to find new loving homes.

I don’t. I hate this name. That is why I need a new home with sane owners who will give me a pretty name… like I deserve! I was found wandering around a bustling urban area. All by myself. My rescuers think I got lost. My foster mama thinks I was abandoned. My vet thinks I was used for breeding. My foster grandmama thinks I was abused. No one really knows my story… no one really knows my pain. Only I know the suffering I have borne. Only I know the darkness I have travelled through. The sad truth is, I will never see light again. You see, I am blind. My previous owners did not take care of me the way they should have. My eyes and ears need meticulous daily care. My poor teeth need to have plaque-remover applied every day followed by gentle brushing. Because my teeth have deteriorated after years of neglect, I smell a little pungent. And that is where my insensitive foster mama thought it was okay to name me Smellanor! Oh, the nerve! Other dogs frighten me. I don’t mean to, but when I am afraid I attack. My foster mama says I am no real danger to anyone. Even if I do charge at another fur-dude or fur-dudette I always miss. To be honest, I seldom know where I am. Being plunged into a world of darkness is not easy. I keep bumping into things and falling into holes. My foster mama thinks it is hilarious to call me Stevie Wondress. That woman needs to get tested! I am old, tired and gray. All I want is a healthy arm to be my stay. I pray that someone will adopt me just to love me and protect me. I am house-trained and extremely obedient. Never will I bark, or bite, or disappoint you. Never will I leave your side, until I leave this world. If you have room in your home and in your heart, would you let me in? Would you spare me a chance to live happily with what is left of my days? I hope the angels whisper in your ear tonight, so you will find your way to me.

I like playing and running around, but sometimes, I like to sit down and ponder about life, or what I'm having for dinner. Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!) The mummy, QT Pie is also up for adoption! For more info, please contact Kelly Tan (preferably whatsapp) Thank you and have a great day!",caa616482,3.0,2,269,479,0.79999995,1.0,95,116,132,0.06849315,0.2910209,dog,0.98485714,0.1,7.6,en,Selangor,6555100,2725.0,0,0,0.001333777925975325,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1

He is extremely tame, sweet and very friendly. Due to his accident, he's very scared of cars. Currently resting at an office, where he needs a fosterer asap. Other info : Very timid, likes to go hiding behind bushes and flower pots while laying still. Probably that's how he survived so long by himself. He's going to the vet tonight- will update this profile tomorrow when we have more info on his leg. Updated 23rd Oct : The vet said he dislocated his hip but to determine the damage an x-ray is needed. However we need to make him put on a bit more weight before the vet agree to sedate him. He got dewormed, and vet also said to wait 2 weeks before his first vaccination. One of his baby tooth is loose and going to fall out as the vet noticed.

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this email and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the terms and conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many emails from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. 1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. 2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. 3) Please DO NOT delete my email with all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. 4) This email is dated 2 February . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. 5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 5 points, please read on: 6) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. 7) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email): - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before 8) No reservations please. First come first served. 9) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. 10) If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at.",b912b1114,5.0,2,399,241,0.79999995,1.0,165,187,207,0.11935484,0.38741365,dog,0.9672477,0.1,13.8,en,Selangor,6555100,2725.0,0,0,0.0010003334444814939,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,1

Her wounded and rugged condition caught my attention- flea, lice and tick infested, with lots of bleeding & weeping wounds all over her body. Despite her painful condition, she was a very happy, cheerful, energetic, positive attitude doggy, the tail wagging all the time. So I brought her to the vet, dewormed, deflead, deticked, vaccinated, spayed. I even shaved all her hair to allow the wounds to heal and so the new beautiful hair could start to grow. She's a beautiful, strong, healthy happy puppy now. Heydee is a very smart alert dog, she learned how to ""sit"" on command in just a few minutes. She's very adorable, cheerful, happy-go-lucky, well-disciplined. I already have 4 big dogs, I can no longer afford to foster her. Please find a home for this adorable chap. She's now staying in a temporary shelter, after 2 weeks I would have no place for her, with no choice but to return her to the streets. Please help, find her a home. She's very friendly to everyone, a good companion & perhaps guard dog too. She's 15kg. If you love dogs and are looking for a companion dog, to walk with you, exercise with you, play with you, cheer you up, destress, turn your mood around - she's the one for you.

I always get what I want, nobody can resist my puppy eyes! I love my cat mummy (seen in picture), my cat brother, Jamie and my little sister Caramel. I love everything!

Poor babies were only 1 week old at most, they still haven't opened their eyes yet. They had to be fed through a bottle because they were so young. But miraculously, one of our foster cats (Miu Miu who we rescued and had a huge tumor on her stomach removed. Miu Miu was nursing our other rescued cat, Jamie also.) was kind and generous enough to nurse them and help take care of them. With Miu miu's help, these babies managed to grow into the bright and spunky puppies they are today! So if you're interested in adopting puppies that were raised by a cat, contact us!

She can understand commands like sit, hand, get in the cage, wait, kiss, hug and carry. She is also very alert, thus makes a good guard. I thought since she's spayed and vaccinated, she'll stand a better chance to be adopted as the new owner won't need to pay more than her annual jabs.

My mum gave birth at the underground car park of an apartment, that’s how me and my siblings were brought to the world, there are 12 of us. Not long after that, my mum was diagnosed with cervical cancer, fortunately she survived after four chemotherapy treatments. And here is my little story. Not long after I was born, I met with an accident and suffered serious concussion, I was wounded with 3 holes in my little head.. Because of that, while all my siblings started to walk I had difficulty to even stand up. In addition to that, I have blurred vision, my cranial nerves were hurt by the accident I suppose.. I have no idea when I’ll recover, maybe it will stay like that forever. Luckily, after 2 months of medication, I’m able to stand and walk now, although I stumbled from time to time. My temporary caretaker has difficulty to keep for me long, I hope that I could meet with a kind master through Facebook. I know people may not like me because of my poor condition, but I’ll pray and hope for a miracle. If you wished to make the miracle happen, please contact my temporary caretaker(Annie). Thank you. 大家好，我的名字叫小龙。我是一只4个多月大的宅男。 妈妈在一个公寓地下停车场里生下了我们12个兄弟姐妹。 妈妈生下了我们之后，得了子宫颈癌。还好，经过4次的化疗之后， 总算挨过了这一关。 好了，说一说我的小故事吧！ 我出世没多久，在一次意外中，我的小脑袋遭到了严重的撞击，破了3个洞。 从此，当其他的兄弟姐妹已经会走路时，我竟然连爬起来都有问题。 还有，我看东西时也是模模糊糊的。我想我的脑部神经可能被弄坏掉了。 我不知道我几时会好起来，或许永远都会是这样。 幸好，吃了两个月的药以后，我总算可以站起来走路。然而，有时还是会跌跌撞撞的。 由于暂养我的主人不能长期收留我，所以我想透过面子书， 寻找一位愿意照顾我一辈子的好心人。 只是，以我这样的生世，或许很难吧。。。。。 有意领养我的好心人，请联络我的暂养主人(Annie)。 我会在这里努力的生活到最后一刻，乖乖的等待我的新主人。请别让我等太久哦。。。 谢谢大家。",0c5d5968b,8.0,3,399,299,0.79999995,1.0,129,150,172,0.12651752,0.6543428,dog,0.98014504,0.0,0.0,zh,Pulau Pinang,1774200,2082.0,0,0,0.0006668889629876625,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1

Thank you! : ) Aura & Solar were rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well socialised after almost a month of fostering them, the 2 kittens are now ready to be rehomed. It's difficult to tell them apart as their coat colour and pattern are exactly the same but looking at their eyes, you will be able to differentiate both the kittens. - They have dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM September (RM12) at a total cost of RM30. - They have been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding them with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - Their weights are 0.55kg & 0.65kg as at 12 September . - They're eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - Aura & Solar have been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM85. - Aura & Solar's behaviour is perfect as pets as they're completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. They would purr happily when held. They are friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept them too) as they're well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The kittens must be adopted together because they keep each other company (and out of trouble). 2) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Their future when you return to your home country. 3) They must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Vaccinate them yearly to protect against diseases. 5) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 6) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover their vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Aura & Solar. If possible, please adopt Aura & Solar at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Aura & Solar, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.

I was sick, and found at a wet market. My eyes were full of discharge, and my nose was blocked. A good market stall seller rescued me, and sent me to a vet. As my saviour has dog, he could not keep me until I am well. He has found me a fosterer, and here, I am given a chance to live until I am healthy. I am very healthy now, I need a permanent home, I don't want to be back on street or market. Please give me a permanent and loving home, and I promise you will not regret this decision. I can be a very good companion, and need very little maintenance. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",01ac09f2a,5.0,3,639,426,0.79999995,1.0,87,119,132,0.20983396,0.23344332,cat,0.9930991,0.1,6.1,en,Pulau Pinang,1774200,2082.0,0,0,0.0010003334444814939,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,1,1

Always snooping into my bags and sometimes car to see what they can loot off with. But they are good problem solvers, if they see me looking really confused with biscuits in my hand (thinking in what order to give them out), they help me by snatching the whole pack and happily distributing that among themselves. But they wait for me every morning at the gate to greet me without fail and when I am leaving work they see me off. They follow my car for a short distance too.

Disebabkan ada banyak anjing di kawasan ni selepas jam 3 pagi, (itu pun jiran2 sekeliling yg bagitau sbb sy baru berpindah ke sini) sy amek keputusan untuk bawak ke rumah saya. His fur has been shaved because of hairball here and there, and also has been neutered. Bobby still in recovery process but he is healthy and eat a lot, his fur is getting softer than before because I give him a salmon oil and special food for his fur and his body getting heavier as well :) I would love to keep him as my pet, but I already have five cats in the house.

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy. Interested parties may text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.",63d254530,22.0,3,399,299,0.79999995,1.0,5,57,154,0.05341658,0.19067356,cat,0.97840774,0.3,15.5,en,Kuala Lumpur,1746600,3037.0,0,0,0.002334111370456819,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,1

BonBon was the only survivor from 5 siblings and was abandoned by her mother so I took her in. She used to be alone. I let her stay in my house with my other cats so she can have friend. She doesn’t mind being around with the adults and just be herself. She is playful, independent and sweet. Her energy level is high and she is very active. She doesn't really like to be cuddled. She likes to play rough. She doesn't meow a lot. She can get along with other cat; just give her time to adjust. She is suitable with a home with 1 or two adult cats. Younger kitten may be bullied by her because she is the baby in my house. Important : This is not an average pet, a cat who will sit on your lap, who love being petted and cuddled. I have her almost 2 months, and catching her to trim her claws or just to hold her still is an ordeal.But she really likes to play, all my cats will lose interest but she's the only one who still eye-balling the toys e.g feather teaser.She never comes to me and rubs herself just like my cats greet me. The only time she's interested to me is when it's feeding time or when no one wants to entertain or play with her. Sometimes she bites to get what she wants. I can give you some advice on how to handle her. If you want her to keep another cat company, she is perfect! And pretty low-maintenance,you can just give her food and water and that's it.

She is about 3-4 weeks old. She is an adorable Calico with a stumpy tail that wiggles when she is super happy. I found her in the middle of a busy road, too scared to move. Luckily she was not hurt. Just shocked. Even from that first encounter, I knew that she is one lovable kitty. Her hobbies include playing with anything that moves, glows or just plain old bits of paper. She loves cuddling to her Mrs Bunny, her bff. Tookins is a natural-born cuddler and a lap kitty. Also a shoulder kitty. Out of all her long list of repetoires, she is also a Youtube and Netflix bingewatcher. She loves teenage movies with good villains in it. Tookins has been checked by the vet and she has been given a clean bill of health. She has been dewormed and deloused (Advocate). She cannot be vaccinated yet as she is so tiny according to the vet. Tookins eats boiled tuna, Whiskas Kitten pouch food and Royal Canin Kitten. She is fully toilet trained and at the moment stays indoors at all times for health and safety reasons. As you can see, she is well loved by my family. As a kitten rescuer and fosterer though, I am willing to share my love for her with a responsible forever family who will care for her unconditionally. If I found her a good home, I can rescue more kittens in need. There is no adoption fee. All I am asking is for Tookins' future mom or dad to: 1. NEUTER her as soon as she can be safely neutered. 2. Make sure her VACCINATIONS are up-to-date 3. Provide her with everything she needs to stay safe, comfortable and happy for the rest of her life. So if you are looking for a quirky, fun-loving, cuddly and not to mention super adorable wee fluff, look no further, for Tookins is your kind of kitten. Please do not hesitate to send me a message. I will then give you a questionaire to be filled in. Thank you.

Arya is also very fond of cuddling. She will sometimes curl up on your lap or even lay next to you and sleep. Arya is also quite intelligent, she finds her way back. She is also adorable because she will follow you around and will greet you at the door (when you come home). She is friendly with other humans and is good with kids (but sometimes she's a bit too playful and jumps around). Arya is really an adorable cat. She is still small and growing.

For some reason, she (the female cat) decided to move her kittens to my place. When i found her, she was hiding in my shoe rack, so, i made them a place to stay; a box, with an old towel, a bowl of water and some kitten food. It was ok for the first 3 days. On the 4th day i noticed the female cat is away for a longer period than usual. As i was away yesterday, i told my brother to keep a lookout for the female cat and it seems she hasnt returned since last night. They have been crying for quite a while and I think they're just hungry. In the mean time, we're taking care of these kittens, feeding it with milk replacement. Appreciate if some kind soul out there would adopt/foster these kittens, preferably someone with a mother cat who just gave birth and wouldnt mind additional members to the family. Update (): Coco and Spotty are on milk replacement diet. Took them to the vet,they're putting on weight which means they're healthy and they are also in good shape.

They weren't abandoned by their parents. It's just that being canine, unlicensed ones, their parents were captured by MBSA two years ago. Since then, residents of have been taking care of them by feeding and sheltering them whenever possible. As they are females, they have all been neutered (at 9 months old) to ensure unsolicited attention from other male canines. Bobby (a female but named such), in human being's term, is like an autistic child. She was traumatised by her parents' abduction at an early age and is extremely afraid of human. She is very attached to Nike (the male Alsation, living in the first house, two doors away). It's extremely difficult to capture her, even MBSA has failed many times. Clever, as she was taken away from her mum at birth(someone adopted her and didn't want her after a few months) and was whining and pining for her for the initial few weeks..... she is pretty hyper, short fused and likes to chase cars.... and strangers.... so I am terribly if anyone here has been chased or barked by her. However, her bark is worse than her bite, just give her a shout and fierce look,she will run off....... She is a very good watch dog though..... and very obediently comes back to the house after she has done her share of running for the night. She doesn't eat much but more frequent than usual (three small portion), not choosy about her food and she's fine with water. She isn't the lovey dovey type though. As for Hong Hong, she is definitely the prima donna type. Loves to be cuddled, will know how to win back your heart after being naughty. She will look at you with her almond shaped eyes and lift her paws and rest them on you...... She's awfully afraid of thunder and will hide behind you or try to get into the house whenever it rains cats and dogs. She hates water and chooses food) For months now, i have kept Clever and Hong Hong in my house. Sometimes they do escaped but they will still head home for food. Bobby, she's outside, she has been taking care of herself. I just feed her dinner every evening. Actually, the three of them are part of a litter of 8. We have managed to get the rest adopted..... It is with a heavy heart that i have to put Clever and Hong Hong up for adoption. One of the main reasons is, my son and I are acute bronchitis sufferers and having dogs in our compound aren't helping with our condition. Secondly, i am having some muslim students coming to my house for classes next year and it is not convenient for the dogs to be around....... Hong Hong can be a really good companion dog and Clever, a good watch dog..... If you know of anyone who is looking for such dogs, please let me know.... my contact no is. Only serious inquiries will be entertained. Thank you very much for your kind attention. BTW, April, one of their siblings, is staying at one of the neighbour's house along too..... so actually is a doggy's lane..... most of us love dogs, and because of them, we are a closely knitted neighbourhood..... we know each other well and watch out for one another..... Hope adopting Hong Hong or Clever will bring such atmosphere to your neighbourhood too.... Cheers..... I am up by one now coz a neighbour who initially taken one of the female pups have decided not to keep the pups......",379d5e10d,1.0,4,399,299,0.79999995,1.0,60,129,107,0.16449879,0.23407294,dog,0.9634299,0.0,13.7,en,Selangor,6555100,2725.0,1,0,0.00033344448149383126,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Fast learner, if you like training your dogs, she is definitely for you. Always focus waiting for instruction. Smaller than a medium size dog. We are just guessing that she have GSD mix from her long nose and big ears, also maybe lil Husky mix because of her fluffy husky-like tail and the rest we will have to continue guessing. Treats and food are her favs. hahah! Extremely affectionate. Love attention. Literally toilet trained. If leave outdoor, she does her business on grass. If indoor, she will do it in the toilet. She is in need of a forever home urgently. Message me now for more details. Vaccinated once. Adopter must agree to spay & continue her vaccination. Also no leashing her up or cage for long hours .

Her coat is slightly diluted so she seems more greyish than brown. - She was rescued on the street by a friend but she is so so human friendly for a street kitty! - Was found very thin and I think she cried a lot..her voice is very rusty or maybe its just like that. - I have dewormed her and have done checkups to see if she has an infection or prarasites. Eats and plays very fine now! - She has minor injury on her chin (thus her name lol) - please refer to images. It is healing. - Again, she is VERY VERY human friendly. She loves to cuddle and sleep right beside me or behind me when I do my work. I go out and come back to find her on my pillow. She calls to sit with me when she's bored playing. - Please make sure to be a responsible owner for this lovely kitty. Bring her for with vaccination.

Maksim is extremely vocal and knows how to talk (meow) back when spoken to. :) ♥ Maksim LOVES being carried over his people's shoulders (he stays put like a parrot and simply enjoys the view he gets). Maksim will also run right over to your lap whenever he's spooked by something (still doesn't stop him from exploring every nook and cranny he can find!) ♥ This boy can be a little demanding when he taps into his manja-moods (asking for cheek-rubs and strokes while he snoozes off).

Already clever with the litter-box and able to eat kibbles independently. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** - Whenever alone, Maksim tries to ""play"" with our fingers during stroking, and sometimes nips. This is only play-biting and a simple ""shh!"" makes him stop immediately. :) He is a very smart kitten and for this reason, experienced cat owners are preferred. - Maksim must be kept INDOORS at all times and NEUTERED at the right age (adopters who already practice neutering their cats preferred). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc).

Neglecting him would have meant leave him to a slow and painful death. I looked after the cat, and his recovery's been great, but still under antibiotic as the biggest holes hasn't sealed completely, hopefully he'll be healed by the end of this week. I am a traveler, and I must leave Malaysia as my visa expires. We've come all the way to KK to find a real home for him, as I am not allowed to cross into other country with the cat. Michi is male, small size, half-short tailed, about 3 years old, and healthy (no skin deseases). He is quiet, sweet, adorable, not picky with his food, and most importantly LOW MAINTAINANCE. It's hard for me to leave him, as he's the most caring thing I have seen in cats. We had great adventures: we hitch-hiked for two days from somewhere near Tawau, to get here. So you can add ""well traveled"" to his qualities. I must leave KK by Sat 11th Aug. Still after this date, please contact me, as I may not have found a place for him.
